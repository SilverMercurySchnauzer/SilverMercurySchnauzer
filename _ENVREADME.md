Twitter key shown in dashboard for your twitter app:
tw_consumer_key=
tw_consumer_secret=

Tokens generated by oauth for twitter, generally these should be blank since 
they are supposed to be replaced when the user authenticates with twitter:
tw_token=
tw_token_secret=

The name of your heroku app so that the callback urls match what is in your facebook/twitter 
app on their server.
So: https://${process.env.heroku_app_name}.herokuapp.com/api/oauth/twitter/authenticatedCallback 
would see ${process.env.heroku_app_name} replaced with pure-river-11017 
heroku_app_name=

I swear these were important but now I can't find them in the code and I'm wondering if they 
were just another name for consumer key:
tw_clientID=
tw_clientSecret=
fb_clientID=
fb_clientSecret=

Also I realized toward the end I'm not really suring where I got the env naming convention from. Its wrong.
Not sure if the correct way is camel casing or allcaps though.
